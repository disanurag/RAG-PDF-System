In\nfact, many would say that they don’t “do policy.” Others maintain that it has only minor\nrelevance to their work – or, for that matter, their lives.\nNot so. We literally eat, drink and breathe public policy.\nPublic policy determines the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. It\naffects the food we eat – how it is harvested, where it is distributed and sold, and how much we\npay. It controls the way in which we clean and monitor (or not in the case of the Walkerton\ntragedy) the safety of the water supply.", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\Anurag Mishra\\aavtaar_rag\\data\\raw_pdfs\\544ENG.pdf", "page_start": 5, "page_end": 5, "is_scanned": false}

The value of this approach is that it allows a customized response to a\nunique set of needs. No two persons with disabilities are alike in their circumstances.\nA lump sum of cash is paid to individuals in respect of their identified needs for both\nincome and disability supports. But the allowance provided for supports, in particular, is not\nintended for the purchase of food or shelter.\nYet the federal government often treats the entire payment as an income benefit and\nrequires that the recipient pay income tax on that benefit.", "pdf_path": "C:\\Users\\Anurag Mishra\\aavtaar_rag\\data\\raw_pdfs\\544ENG.pdf", "page_start": 21, "page_end": 21, "is_scanned": false}

Implementing the measure and assessing its impact\nThis paper does not focus upon the implementation or assessment of public policy\n– which are complex processes that require their own discussion. But it is clear that\nimplementation is crucial to effectiveness, efficiency and consistency. A plan that may be\nexcellent on paper could end up being very different from its intent if not properly\nimplemented. It may be too slow, there may be too little investment for effective application or\nthe policy may be inconsistent with other objectives or measures.\nIdeally, all policies and programs should assess and correct their course on an ongoing\nbasis.
