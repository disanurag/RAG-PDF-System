As of September 2021, about\n131,000 mortality cases had been reported.1 By the third quarter of 2020, an\nestimated 15 million full-time jobs had been lost,2 and a study from early 2020\nestimated that 8.3 million people in the region would be pushed into poverty.3\nTo mitigate the effects of the pandemic, countries had to rapidly find solutions\ndespite resource limitations and challenging circumstances.\nThe present policy brief sheds the light on social protection interventions as\npart of wider fiscal support measures implemented by Governments in the Arab\nregion to cushion the repercussions of the pandemic on private households.

See\nESCWA glossary, available\nat https://www.unescwa.\norg/sd-glossary/fiscal-op­\nerations. According to\nthe COVID-19 Stimulus\nTracker, government\nfiscal support spending is\nbroadly categorized into\nsocial assistance, loans\nand tax benefit, social\ninsurance, labour markets,\nhealth-related support,\nfinancial policy support,\ngeneral policy support,\nand multiple (non-disag­\ngregated) policies.\nGiven the significant heterogeneity\nof the region’s economies,\nthe vulnerability as well as the\nresponses varied greatly between\ngroups of countries as defined\nby their average gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) per capita.\nAs of September 2021, fiscal\nsupport5 in the Arab region\namounted to $95.2 billion. Out of\nthe total regional fiscal support,\nhigh-income countries (HICs) have\nextended $70 billion or 5.1 per cent\nof their GDP of 2020, and the lower\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs)\nhave extended about $18.7 billion\nor about 2.7 per cent of their GDP\nof 2020. The low-income countries\n(LICs) and upper middle-income\ncountries (UMICs) have extended\nonly about $3.7 billion and $2.7\nbillion respectively, namely 5 per\ncent and 1 per cent of their GDP of\n2020 (figure 1).\nIn this context, it is worth noting that\n9 per cent of fiscal support went to\nsocial protection measures at the\nglobal level, while in the Arab region\ntwice this share – about 18 per cent\n– was spent on social protection.\nFig 1\nGovernment fiscal support in the\nregion, by income level (Billions\nof dollars)\n2.7\n3.7\n18.7\n70.1\n95.2\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nUMIC\nLIC\nLMIC\nHIC\nArab region\nHIC: high-income countries; LMIC: lower middle-income countries; LIC: low-income\ncountries; UMIC: upper middle-income countries", "ocr": null}

Beneficiaries of\ngovernment fiscal support:\nWho gets how much?\nAs figure 3 illustrates, social\nprotection spending patterns related\nto COVID-19, in terms of target\ngroups, in the UMICs, LMICs and\nLICs of the Arab region mirror the\nspending patterns of their peers in\nother regions. While UMICs mostly\nspent to protect employees and the\nself-employed, likely reflecting the\nneed to extend income support to\nthe hard hit informal sector workers\nin these countries, LMICs and LICs\nacross regions largely extended\nfiscal support to families. This\nfamily support possibly indicates\nthat LMICs and LICs made use of\nexisting social assistance\nprogrammes by expanding them\nhorizontally by covering additional\nfamilies, and vertically by topping up\nthe benefit levels.\nInterestingly, the Arab region’s HICs\nshow a spending pattern that is\ndistinctly different from HICs in other\nregions, which largely spent on\nsupport for employees, the self-\nemployed and families. In contrast, the\nArab region’s HICs spent almost three\nquarters of their fiscal support for\nspecific vulnerable groups such as\npatients, persons with disabilities,\nimprisoned and homeless persons,\nand female-headed households. This\ndistinct spending pattern possibly\nreflects differences in the Arab\nregion’s HICs, namely the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) countries,\nwhere the labour market composition\nis marked by a relatively small share of\ninformal workers and a comparatively\nlow labour market participation rate,\nespecially for women.", "ocr": null}
