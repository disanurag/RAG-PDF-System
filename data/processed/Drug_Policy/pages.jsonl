Drug use can\ntherefore only worsen in the coming years. The drug problem is most acute in the capital, but has\nnow extended in the rest of the country.\nThe Albanian national drug strategy expired in 2010, and a new strategy needs to be established. In\nthe previous drug strategy, the Ministry of Public Health has been willing to support harm reduction\nprogrammes, and so is the police now that the positive results of harm reduction have been\ndemonstrated regarding reductions in drug-related crime and health problems. However, data\ncollection remains scarce on users who are not street-based.\nHarm reduction services started to be developed in 1995 in Albania. Aksion Plus was the first NGO\nto provide needle and syringe exchange programmes (NSPs). Today, three NGOs run NSPs for\nstreet drug users (Aksion Plus, APRAD and Stop AIDS), a service that now reaches 1,800 clients.\nAksion Plus will soon be opening a new centre in the North of the country.\nIn 2005, Aksion Plus also started to provide methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), which is\nnow being scaled up with the support of the Harm Reduction Development Program and Andrej\nKastelic. Five MMT programmes have now been established in the capital and four main cities of\nAlbania, providing treatment services to 396 clients. In Tirana alone, 147 people are treated in MMT\nfacilities. The treatment is community based and benefits from the support of the Ministry of Health\nand the Global Fund. It is a friendly space where drug users are well treated by the staff. The Tirana\nfacility is run by three doctors, nurses and outreach workers. Aksion Plus is expecting to get the\npermission to open new premises soon.\nAksion Plus is also working in prisons and at police stations. Harm reduction services are provided\nin five prisons in the country. The services provided include information, MMT, counselling, peer\neducation, training of medical or psychosocial personnel, testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C, and\ncondom provision.\nA collaborative project funded by the European Commission was recently set up to increase\ncollaboration between the NGO sector working on drugs issues and the probation service. This\nproject, run by three partnership NGOs (Aksion Plus, APRAD and Stop AIDS), aims to train judges\nand prosecutors on harm reduction and develop a new philosophy on how to tackle drug users in\ngeneral.\nThe harm reduction model adopted by Aksion Plus is now being followed by a number of other\nNGOs. The Albanian government is very pleased with this model and even assigns Aksion Plus with\nseveral tasks. For example, Aksion Plus is invited to participate in high level meetings on drug\npolicy. However, the government believes that methadone should be prescribed by doctors, not\nNGOs.\nThe presenter recommended that:\n•\nThe infrastructure and the quality of services should be improved.\n•\nReferral services and proper follow up of clients should be strengthened.\n•\nA drop-in centre should be set up for street sex workers who use drugs.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The media is also very supportive of harm reduction\ninterventions. UNICEF facilitates the communication process between the government and NGOs.\nFinally, the Global Fund CCM enables NGOs and the government to discuss what works and what\ncould be improved.\nBosnia-Herzegovina\nThere are between 7,500 and 10,000 IDUs in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The government has\nadopted a national strategy and several action plans to tackle the drugs issue. NGOs are usually\ninvolved in the elaboration of such documents through public hearings.\nHowever, BiH has a very complicated government administration, with over 160 ministries working\nat different levels of government. This makes it very difficult to have a coordinated approach for\ndrug policy.\nThe most important problem in BiH relates to criminal law and the implementation of criminal\nsanctions. This issue could be resolved if the articles referring to human rights, IDUs and prisoners\nare modified. NGO Viktorija and Association Margina hope to develop a short law review process\nthrough a period of two to three years, which should go hand in hand with educational interventions\ntargeted at policy makers to raise awareness on drugs issues. Indeed, the educational initiatives\nthat have been developed so far have had some positive effects on the police on the ground.\nNGOs started to get involved in the field of harm reduction in 2002 to strengthen the health sector in\nBiH. Seven MMT centres have now been opened with financial support from the Global Fund. NGO\nViktorija and Association Margina have spread their harm reduction activities to several\ndecentralised urban areas.\nThe presenting NGOs stated that every NGO should have a leading role in improving the\nproblematic aspects of national policy regarding harm reduction. It is necessary to study the\nsituation in the field, inform and educate policy makers on practical experience, and form\npartnerships with relevant government stakeholders. Political pressure from the European Union\nand other regional or international organisations of which BiH is a member can help push for\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The engagement of policy makers is crucial to ensure the sustainability of existing services\nbeyond 2016, when existing funding from the Global Fund and other large donors will end.\nNGOs are getting involved with the government, but it is difficult to develop close relationships with\nthe most relevant government representatives. Financial support and increased cooperation and\npartnerships are the only ways to provide cheap and accessible services to people who need them.\nThe development of strategies and action plans for drugs, and the establishment of an expert group\n(which included NGO representatives) to draft the new strategy for HIV/AIDS for 2010-2015, are\ngood examples of how governments and NGOs can work together on harm reduction issues.\nThe presenting NGOs reported that it was difficult to report examples of best practice because they\nfelt that little quality analysis of harm reduction had been conducted in the region. It is therefore\ndifficult to know who works in what in the field of harm reduction. One of the key roles of this\nNetwork should be to analyse the drugs and harm reduction situation in every country in South East\nEurope.\nThe presenters recommended that:\n•\nEducation, drug law reform, information, campaigns and conferences should occur\ncontinuously.\n•\nGovernments should accept to work in partnership with NGOs and support services with an\nappropriate allocation of resources.\n•\nThe Network should be clearly organised in order to lobby at the European Commission and\nother relevant bodies to foster new activities and promote harm reduction in the region.\nAt the end of the presentation, one of the participants pointed at several research studies on best\npractice in harm reduction in the region, including reports from the World Health Organisation and\nfrom the Bristol University (the latter dating from 2006).\nCroatia\nHarm reduction programmes have existed in Croatia since 1995 through the NGO Help from Split.\nThere are now harm reduction programmes in four major cities in Croatia, but all of them are being\noperated by NGOs. Association Terra started working in the field of harm reduction in 2000, mainly\nas a support for local governments.\nHarm reduction is now recognised and financially supported by the Ministry of Health. It was\nfinanced by the Global Fund from 2003 to 2006. The Global Fund has been an important actor to\nestablish good relationships with the government, and since 2006, harm reduction activities have\nalso been funded by the Croatian government. For instance, substitution treatment is well\ndeveloped and free of charge for those who need it. Despite these improvements, harm reduction is\nfar from being a priority for the Croatian government.\nAccording to the National Network of Therapeutic Communities (NNTC), there are now four\ntherapeutic communities in the country, providing services to about 800 clients. These communities\nuse a scientific approach and employ multidisciplinary professionals and experts. They aim to\nprovide the social services that the government does not provide (the NNTC do not provide\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The NNTC signs yearly contracts with the Ministry of Health, and the\ngovernment covers 60% of the costs of the services provided. The NNTC is staffed with 32\nprofessionals, half of them being experts, the other half being rehabilitated drug addicts. This\ncombination of knowledge and experience enables the organisation to elaborate an adequate\nresponse to the needs of the clients.\nThe NNTC is now trying to scale up and improve the quality of the services provided, but is\nexperiencing difficulties in doing so. For instance, since the psychosocial services the organisation\nprovided is of much better quality than before, between 2002 and 2004, donors refused to provide\nmore support to the organisation, considering that it was not needed.\nOver 80% of addicts take substitution therapy in Croatia. A number of heroin addicts decided to stop\nusing heroin and started to integrate the programmes offered by the NNTC. This did not change\nNNTC’s mission (they did not start to provide substitution therapy), but the organisation did adapt to\nthe situation. One of the centres started to work with heroin addicts in collaboration with the\nRegional Centre for Prevention, which is a national public health institution. There are now 22 such\nmedical centres in the country that are habilitated to prescribe methadone, whereas the NNTC\nprovides psychosocial treatment. The treatment usually lasts three to six months. Then, the patients\ndecide to go home or to go to another institution which combines medical and psychosocial\ntreatment.\nThe State provides good reinsertion programmes for rehabilitated dependent users: at the end of\nthe treatment, these programmes help them to go back to school or start a new job. For example,\nemployers get benefits if they employ former addicts. Such programmes have been implemented for\nthe past two to three years, and good results have been recorded in that domain. However, under\nnew Croatian law, HIV and hepatitis testing is no longer possible for people without a health\ninsurance, and doctors cannot give any treatment to people who do not have a health insurance.\nThe presenter said that despite this situation, her relations with government authorities tended to be\ndifficult and conflictive. Indeed, although NGOs are included in governmental programmes, it seems\nthat the national government does not recognise their true value and they are often put aside rather\nthan acknowledged as valuable partners. A comprehensive system is needed in Croatia to provide\nappropriate and diversified forms of treatment for drug addicts. In that perspective, the NNTC\nproposed 14 measures to the government, but 12 years later, little has been done to adopt such\nmeasures. On the contrary, a very repressive law was changed in 2006 to become even more\nrepressive for drug addicts involved in criminal acts, especially for low-scale dealing (possession of\n2 to 3 doses now leads to a minimal punishment of 2 years’ imprisonment). The presenter\norganised a round table with experts on drug policy who agreed that the law should be modified, but\nit is unsure as to whether the government will do so. NGOs should lead in influencing public policies\nin the long run.\nOne of the elements that could be improved in the field of harm reduction is the funding system.\nCurrently, NGOs have to apply for funding every year. The presenters declared that recognising\nNGOs as partners and providing them funding on a longer basis would enable them to have longer-\nterm projects.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The country now counts with 15 harm reduction programmes in 13\ncities. Since FYR Macedonia is a small country, harm reduction seems to be well developed, with\nover 1,500 people benefiting from methadone treatment, with a few being under buprenorphine\ntherapy. Substitution therapy is free of charge in FYR Macedonia. The main issue is that these\nservices entirely depend on funding from international donors.\nOne of the main issues in FYR Macedonia is the law. Several attempts have been made to push for\nreform, but the government has refused to change them so far. NGOs are important partners in the\ndrug strategy implemented by the government, but are not represented at the drug commission,\nwhich is a major issue.\nAt the local level, NGOs have usually developed good cooperative relations with local authorities.\nFor instance, a drug body was established to set up the local drug strategy, in collaboration with\nrelevant NGOs. For the presenter, the Network is a key actor to support surveys on the cost-\neffectiveness of harm reduction programmes, and to train politicians and representatives of political\nparties.\nOne of the key recommendations from the presenter was that harm reduction be included in\nnational and local government budgets.\nGreece\nIn Greece, two main organisations are involved in drugs issues. The first one is OKANA, a State\norganisation aiming to combat illicit drugs. The second one is the NGO KETHEA.\nOKANA is a large organisation established in the mid-1990s, which focuses on harm reduction\nservices. OKANA runs 18 opioid substitution treatment programmes, including 14 methadone\nprogrammes and 4 buprenorphine programmes. In addition to these government-operated services,\nKETHEA runs abstinence-based treatment programmes providing psychosocial support. These\nprogrammes run hand in hand.\nOne of the main issues with OKANA is that it is highly bureaucratic and political. Therefore, new\npolicies are difficult to establish and implement. This is a problem because the waiting list to attend\nsuch services is long and the system still needs to be improved. Nevertheless, the overall situation\nis still positive since harm reduction services are well accepted and implemented by the Greek\ngovernment.\nMontenegro\nDrug abuse is a very recent problem in Montenegro: heroin only appeared in the country in 1993.\nThe country was mainly unprepared to face the problem and Montenegro has experienced\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

Finally, there is a\nknowledge gap among policy makers on the topic.\nThe NGOs providing harm reduction services do not benefit from the support of the government,\nand need a special permission from the police department to operate since harm reduction\n(including the provision of methadone) remains illegal under the laws of the country. Methadone\ntreatment has been provided in the capital since 2004, but only nine beds are provided in the\nfacility. Two NGOs also provide clean needles and syringes. In 2010, information packages were\ndeveloped and a drop-in centre was established, but these projects are still underdeveloped.\nAnother harm reduction project was also elaborated two years ago in Serbia and Montenegro, but it\nhas not yet been implemented.\nFor now, there is no joint action on harm reduction in Montenegro, and people working in the harm\nreduction field do not work with governmental institutions. Government officials working in the drugs\nfield are very difficult to reach, and many NGOs end up giving up on their advocacy activities\ntowards policy makers. There is also a clear lack of information about the harm reduction\nprogrammes developed in the country, and a lack of skilled people within governmental institutions\non drugs issues. Finally very few NGOs actually work in the drugs field.\nThis situation needs to change. The presenter recommended that positive pressure should be made\non Montenegro by the European Union to push the government to legalise harm reduction. This\napproach would be effective since Montenegro is at a pre-accession stage to the EU.\nThe presenter stated that IDPC and the Network could make an important contribution by analysing\nand evaluating the implementation of existing harm reduction programmes. The organisation of\nstudy visits with key decision makers to examine examples of best practice (such as Slovenia where\nthe government is funding harm reduction projects developed within the communities) would also be\nbeneficial for Montenegro.\nRomania\nMost harm reduction services in Romania are based in Bucharest, but there are currently signs of\ndrug use in other cities around the capital. Harm reduction services have so far been developed in\nRomania by NGOs, with international support from UNICEF, the United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime (UNODC) and the Global Fund. Harm reduction services do operate, but are still\nunderdeveloped. For example, there was an insufficient supply of clean syringes. The Romanian\nHarm Reduction Network (RHRN) tried to put pressure on the Ministry of Health to initiate an\nemergency plan to secure clean syringes. It was only thanks to international pressure and the\npublication of an article in the Times Magazine that the Ministry reacted and started to provide more\nsyringes. The RHRN played a key role in facilitating contacts with the Times Magazine. Regarding\nsubstitution therapy, it also remains underdeveloped, with only 1,000 dependent users being able to\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The RHRN also participates in media activities to influence the debate and inform the\ngeneral population on drugs issues.\nNGOs are usually consulted on drug policy issues. However, they only have an advisory role in the\npolicy making process. In December 2008, the Deputy Chamber President initiated consultations\nwith civil society representatives to review the current drug law. In February 2010, a debate was\nhosted by the Deputy Chamber, to which the RHRN participated. The Ministry of Justice is now\nexpected to nominate experts to analyse the NGO proposals with regards to reducing or eliminating\npenalties for possession of illicit drugs for personal use, a necessary measure to foster drug users’\nparticipation to harm reduction programmes. For now, the legislative process is being blocked at the\nlevel of the Ministry of Justice.\nIn March 2008, the National Anti-Drugs Agency (NAA), which was until then under the authority of\nthe Ministry of Administration and Interior, was restructured and transformed into a simple service\nunder the authority of the Romanian Police Inspectorate. This measure reduced the institution’s\npower and credibility, and as a result, many experts decided to leave the institution. The NAA on\nDrugs is now very weak, has no power over the State apparatus, and Romania has not had an\naction plan for the National Anti-Drug Strategy since 2008: the NAA proposed a draft action plan in\nMay 2010, NGOs then requested that the NAA organise a public debate to discuss the action plan,\nwhich was never done. The process stopped at that point.\nThe RHRN initiated discussions with the local government, but this advocacy work has had no\nresults so far. The RHRN is also a member of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs in the European\nCommission. The presenter declared that there was a long way ahead to include drug policy as a\npriority at all levels of government.\nThe RHRN recommended that:\n•\nThe National Agency on Drugs should be restored as an independent body.\n•\nThe Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour should get involved in harm reduction\npolicies under their public health and social interventions.\n•\nLocal authorities should provide financial support to these harm reduction services.\n•\nAn enabling environment should be created for harm reduction services, through a review of\ndrug laws, education to reduce stigma, and an increase in general social services.\n•\nWith regards to the action plan for 2010-2012, a public debate should be organised to\nprovide a platform for discussion between the government and NGO representatives. This\nshould include:\n\u0001 Clarify the financial mechanisms to support NGO service providers targeting drug users\n\u0001 Provide a budget estimation for planned activities and their financial source\n\u0001 Clarify each institution’s responsibility in terms of financial and human resources\n\u0001 Define a coordination/cooperation mechanism between the institutions mentioned in the\naction plan\n\u0001 Clarify the problem of access to medical and psycho-social services for underage drug\nusers\n\u0001 Document the prevalence of drug use in Romania.\n•\nFor the region, the RHRN recommended that drug offences should be decriminalised or\ndepenalised (except those related to drug trafficking), drug classification should be reviewed,\ntherapeutic justice should be strengthened, harm reduction should be scaled up in the\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

These recommendations are aimed at us all, and we should\nconstantly remind governments of it.\nThe presenter declared that IDPC and the Network could support NGOs in Romania with\ninformation on shared experiences (especially how governments can respond to NGO advocacy\nactivities), and the organisation of country visits, seminars and workshops. The aim of these events\nis to create a common vision and agree on a set of principles and actions to be implemented at the\nregional level.\nSerbia\nThe drugs situation in Serbia is similar to that of FYR Macedonia. There are no precise data on the\nnumber of problem drug users in Serbia, the numbers are estimated at 11,000 to 100,000. The main\ndrug dependence problems are linked to poly drug use and the use of amphetamine type stimulants\n(ATS). A national data centre is currently being created to improve data collection.\nSince 2002, there have been interesting developments and improvements in the field of harm\nreduction in Serbia. The government has been more proactive in the field, and has adopted a new\nlaw. At the same time as the UNODC and the World Health Organisation started to promote harm\nreduction initiatives, INSADA – and more recently the Global Fund – allocated funds in Serbia for\nthe development of methadone treatment and general healthcare.\nA national drug strategy and an action plan were designed last year. The main focus of the strategy\nwas to improve coordination between ministries, and between the government and international\nagencies. The strategy also aims to reduce drug supply, and increase research and information on\nillicit drugs. Harm reduction is well recognised in the country and financed internationally and by the\nMinistry of Health and other government departments. Methadone has been provided in Belgrade\nsince the 1980s. For the past six years, MMT programmes have been developed in other Serbian\ncities. There are now 15 to 20 centres throughout the country. Buprenorphine was introduced in the\n1990s and is now licensed in Serbian laws. NGO Veza managed to create close links with the\nMinistry of Health to discuss the need for regulation in order to facilitate the provision of harm\nreduction services. A working group is currently discussing these regulations. In May 2010, a new\nproject was developed by NGO Veza for young IDUs, in collaboration with State institutions. This\ninitiative has strengthened the links between NGO Veza and governmental clinics, and the NGO\ncan now use better structures to take care of drug users.\nSimilarly, there seems to be better coordination with the police in the field of harm reduction. NGO\nVeza hands out leaflets at police stations, and is seeking additional funding to provide training to\npolice officers on harm reduction and prevention, and how the police can cooperate on the matter.\nA national strategy for HIV/AIDS is also included in government planning. NGO Veza’s\nrecommendations were accepted and the NGO was able to met people from different agencies to\ndiscuss drugs issues.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The government is also working on a new law on\nprevention, treatment and rehabilitation from drug abuse. Internationally, the government has a\nnational focal person responsible for communicating with the EMCDDA, and the government also\ncollaborates with EUROPAD and the Global Fund. With regards to civil society involvement, the\npresenter declared that NGOs should be patient and persistent in their advocacy work with national\ngovernments.\nAccording to some participants, collaboration and consultations should be further strengthened\nbetween NGOs and government officials. Regarding drug law reform, IDPC could be useful to\norganise an event with legal experts who could explain how this works in the rest of Europe. Such\nan intervention would perfectly complement what is currently being implemented by NGOs in the\ncountry. IDPC could also support NGOs to approach policy makers, through the organisation’s\nexpertise on how to create a political platform and how best to elaborate effective drug laws.\nFinally, one of the presenters reminded the participants of the importance of using the IDPC Drug\nPolicy Guide because it provided information on concrete steps forward for effective drug policy.\nIDPC should be able to provide more details about the Guide – this would be an important\ncontribution from IDPC to this Network. The IDPC webpage on South East Europe could also be\nused as a forum of discussions to ask questions on drug policy.\nThe IDPC representative reminded the participants that IDPC had a project on drug law reform in\npartnership with the Transnational Institute. For now, the project is mainly supporting governments\nand civil society in Latin America. The activities also included the setting up of a network of lawyers\nand judges to conduct a review of drug policies at the national level in the region. It might be\ninteresting to develop similar programmes in the work plan for South East Europe next year.\nSlovenia\nHarm reduction services started to be provided in Slovenia at the end of the 1980s, as a drug users’\ninitiative. Drug users then started to influence policy makers and the media. The first drug strategy\nwas developed in 1992, which formed a good basis for the development of future harm reduction\ninterventions. At the end of the 1990s, two laws were passed, one on drug trade and production, the\nother on prevention of illicit drug use. Article 13 of that second law covers harm reduction, allowing\nfor the distribution of intravenous injection needles and other services. This law constitutes the legal\nbasis for harm reduction in Slovenia, and has not been changed ever since.\nIn 2004, a new drug programme was adopted for the period extending from 2004 to 2010. A new\nstrategy is now being drafted by a commission constituted of representatives of the Ministry of\nHealth. A working group was also set up and includes two NGO representatives having extensive\nknowledge and experience of drug policy (Drug Art and the Association of Drug NGOs).\nThe Ministry of Social Welfare recently released a report on activities in the drugs field which\nincluded an entire chapter on harm reduction. The report stated that in 2009 the government co-\nfinanced 18 harm reduction programmes, allocating a budget of € 1 million to harm reduction (this\ncovered 90% of the costs incurred by harm reduction services).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

The presenter also declared that harm reduction services needed to be\nscaled up to more cities in the country. Finally, awareness of drugs issues should be increased\nbecause, even though the drugs situation has stabilised in Slovenia, too few people consider drug\npolicy as a priority issue.\nConcluding remarks for Session I\n•\nThe movement towards developing harm reduction is moving slowly, but in an overall\npositive way. There is a movement towards more understanding of each other and the harm\nreduction issue, and there is also more cooperation.\n•\nRelationships with governments are also moving forward. Harm reduction is better\nrecognised, but governments must get further involved in the issue.\n•\nPressure from outside works. The expectations links to the accession to the EU are an\nimportant incentive in the field of drugs.\n•\nThere is a clear willingness within the Network to work together on resolving current issues\nin the region. Some of the participants have called the Network to:\n\u0001 Conduct research and analysis of the drugs and harm situation in every country in the\nregion.\n\u0001 Analyse and evaluate the implementation of existing harm reduction programmes, and\nprovide surveys on the cost-effectiveness of harm reduction programmes.\n\u0001 Set up principles and actions to be implemented at the regional level to foster the\ndevelopment of harm reduction initiatives.\n\u0001 Use the IDPC Guide as a basis for political engagement.\n•\nIDPC can support the region with the following activities:\n\u0001 Provide an analysis of what works in other regions of the world.\n\u0001 Organise trainings of professionals and policy makers.\n\u0001 Organise country visits, seminars and workshops to examine examples of best practice\nfrom other countries.\n\u0001 Support NGOs' involvement with policy makers with the provision information on how to\ncreate an enabling political platform for engagement.\n\u0001 Create a page on the IDPC website on South East Europe.\n\u0001 Create an online forum of discussions on drug policy.\nSession II. The Roma population and drugs in SEE countries\nAlbania\nThe Roma population constitutes 16% of the clients at Aksion Plus, and are often in poor health.\nSometimes, entire families use drugs. The heroin sold in neighbourhoods inhabited by Roma\npopulations is usually of poor quality, and Roma drug users are also often drug dealers. Although it\nseems necessary to create a separate harm reduction project for Roma people, such an initiative\ndoes not exist in Albania.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

According to\nthe survey, about 16% of those interviewed had used drugs at least once. The most frequent age\nfor drug use is 16 years old, but some start to use drugs as early as 13 years old. Drugs are used in\nvery poor hygienic conditions (58% used drugs in the street, 25% in bars or cafes, and only 17% at\nhome), and often engage in risky sexual behaviour (half of those interviewed had never used a\ncondom).\nThe survey demonstrated that this group was highly vulnerable to health problems because:\n•\nFew individuals were informed about the risks associated with drug use: only 3% believed\nthat they were at risk of HIV and other STIs, and only 10% of the respondents had been\ntested for HIV/AIDS.\n•\nNo one had been tested for hepatitis B or C.\n•\nFew respondents knew where to go for healthcare services. The stigma associated with\nRoma populations and drug use deters them from accessing proper treatment when they\nneed it.\n•\nThe respondents reported high levels of violence associated with crime, the police and\npeers.\n•\nRoma people often have a low level of education and life skills.\n•\nSocial norms among Roma people are conducive to early sex and alcohol abuse.\nThe following programmes should be developed to tackle the issue:\n•\nA mapping exercise needs to be conducted to identify the main issues and needs of sex\nworkers and IDUs. This exercise was recently initiated by UNFPA and UNICEF.\n•\nNSPs should be more accessible to Roma drug users.\n•\nReferrals to other services and medical assistance should be established whenever needed.\n•\nCounselling, capacity building, training, coaching are necessary among Roma populations.\nFor now, Roma groups and NGOs are not very active and Aksion Plus is trying to support\nthem to develop this work.\n•\nAksion Plus is often in contact with the police and other human rights structures to protect\nthe human rights of the Roma populations. Much more needs to be done in that domain.\nBosnia-Herzegovina\nThe Roma are the largest minority in BiH. The latest statistics on Roma populations in BiH dates\nfrom 1990, but the organisation World Vision has been working with Roma populations for the past\n20 years. World Vision has conducted a mapping of the population and has identified 76,000 Roma\nin BiH, more than 80% of them living in very poor conditions. These groups usually live near the\nbiggest city.\nIn the programmes developed by Association Margina, the Roma population is not considered as a\nspecial minority. For the Association, a user is a user, and the Association therefore everybody is\ntreated equally. The Association could not even tell how many Roma clients were served in the\ndrop-in centres.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

In 2010, the\ngovernment has spent € 1.5 million on Roma, and Roma NGOs constitute one of the most\norganised sector of civil society in the country (there are over 120 NGOs working with Roma in BiH).\nThese NGOs are organised as a Council of Roma representatives at the country level to negotiate\ndirectly with the government. For Round 9 of the Global Fund, € 2 million will be dedicated to work\nwith Roma populations. In a few years, the Roma population will probably be fully integrated in\nBosnian mainstream society.\nBulgaria\nThe Roma population is the second largest, but also the poorest and most marginalised, minority in\nthe country. According to official data, there are over 370,000 Roma individuals, but there could be\ntwice as more in reality. In Sofia alone, there were reportedly 70,000 Roma people. About 80% of\nRoma are permanently unemployed. Their life expectancy is 10 years shorter than the average\npopulation of the country.\nThe estimated number of drug users among Roma populations is 1,000 people, mainly injecting\nheroin. Injecting drug use not only starts during adolescence (12-13 years old), but also during\nadulthood, for individuals aged over 25. Heroin used by Roma communities is usually of lower\nquality than that used among other ethnic groups.\nAmong those tested by IHF, around 55 were reportedly HIV positive. There is very little information\namong Roma people about the harms associated with drug use, and therefore the tendency to\nshare un-sterilised needles is high. This situation is worsened by the fact that it is difficult for Roma\npopulations to access sterile injecting equipment because of the high stigma associated with Roma\nand drug use, especially for women. There is also a high level of unsafe sexual behaviour among\nRoma communities.\nIn Sofia, IHF opened an outreach centre in 1999, a drop-in centre in 2006 and a MMT programme in\n2007 in Roma quarters. These initiatives need a specific planning process in order to follow the\nspecificities of the Roma, respect the hierarchy within the community, provide services that are not\nnecessarily specific to drug use, and create active contacts with Roma families.\nSome services are being provided to Roma people in collaboration with other agencies. These\ninclude inpatient treatment at the National Centre for Addiction; outpatient detoxification at the Sofia\nMunicipality Centre for Addictions; drug abuse counselling, HIV testing and medical care at a mobile\nunit; case management for HIV positive people; STI testing, counselling and treatment at the\nMedecins sans Frontieres Sexual Health Centre; and day care for homeless young Roma at the\n‘16+’ Day Care Centre.\nWhat seems to be most needed among Roma populations is NSPs. Although the Roma community\ndoes not agree with these services, they accept NSPs and do not seek to disturb their good\nfunctioning. Outreach teams also provide information both to drug users and the entire community\nto prevent risky behaviours and avoid social stigma. Access to drug dependence treatment is also\nproblematic because if a person does not have a health insurance, it is almost impossible for\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

In\naddition, it seems that Roma organisations avoid working with IDUs in their communities. It is\ntherefore very difficult to hire Roma outreach workers.\nThe presenters recommended that:\n•\nMore NSPs should be established for Roma populations.\n•\nHIV infections should be properly monitored among Roma populations.\n•\nHealth services should be established closer to the community.\n•\nLocal Roma organisations should start getting involved in harm reduction interventions.\n•\nRoma IDUs should be trained in harm reduction.\nCroatia\nAccording to a general census conducted in 2001, there are 9,464 Roma people in Croatia.\nHowever, the numbers are believed to be much higher, between 30,000 and 40,000, representing\nalmost 1% of the total population. There are two Roma settlements in Croatia, with around 400\nRoma people. These groups declare themselves as Croatians, but at the same time, they create\nproblems for local populations.\nThere does not seem to be any significant difference in drug abuse among the Roma population\ncompared to the overall population. However, the Roma population has a lower level of education,\nreport higher levels of poverty, and more frequently discriminated against compared to the general\npopulation.\nIn general, data on drug use are not listed according to nationality criteria. It is therefore very difficult\nto find information on drug use within Roma communities. It is also difficult to get data on the\nprevalence of HIV among Roma populations because they are unavailable or because Roma\ncommunities are unwilling to participate to the surveys.\nAn action plan was recently developed in Croatia to promote the social inclusion of Roma\npopulations, but this plan did not include any aspect of drug use.\nIn 2003, the project RiskNet was developed among Roma communities to provide them with\ninformation on prevention for HIV and other STIs. After intensive work, a programme was also\ndeveloped in 2009 with financial support from international organisations to meet the leaders of\nRoma communities and talk to them about drug use and the harms associated to it. However, it was\nimpossible to get in contact with women or talk about sex safe.\nAssociation Terra is usually not included in the discussions that take place among the local, regional\nand national policy makers on issues related to the Roma population.\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\nAccording to official data collected in 2002, FYR Macedonia is home to 54,000 individuals of Roma\nethnicity, representing 2.6% of the overall population.

But the real figure is probably much higher. Roma populations in FYR Macedonia have their\nown political party, which is represented at the Macedonian Parliament. The largest Roma\nmunicipality is in Skopje, with 25,000 Roma people; the mayor of the municipality is Roma.\nThe Roma population started using drugs in late 1990s early 2000. Most of them use heroin, and\npoly drug use remains rare in the country.\nThe first research study on risky behaviours among Roma populations was conducted in 2000 by\nHealthy Options Project Skpoje (HOPS), with the support of the American Refugee Committee. The\nstudy showed that:\n•\nPeople start using drugs either very early (as early as 10 years old), or rather late (at 45\nyears old).\n•\nSome street myths still prevail among Roma people, for example: you will not get AIDS if\nyou warm up your needle before using it to inject drugs.\n•\nThere is a very low knowledge of illicit drugs and associated harms.\n•\nRoma families are usually very large and live in very small rooms.\n•\nOnly 37% of Roma people have a health insurance.\nIn 2002, HOPS started the first harm reduction programme specially aimed at Roma IDUs. The\nprogramme provides medical services (bandaging wounds, treating abscesses, education on drug\nuse, safe injecting and safe sex, voluntary counselling and testing, etc.). There is also a social\nworker, along with a lawyer who gives free legal aid to the clients. To date, HOPS has provided\nservices to 286 Roma IDUs.\nIn 2009, with the support of the Roma Health Programme from OSI Budapest, HOPS launched a\nproject to develop the capacity building of institutions and NGOs working in the Roma municipality\nof Shuto Orizari. The key objective of the project was to establish a local commission to improve the\nhealth and social status of vulnerable communities in this community (drug users, sex workers and\nLGBT groups). The commission was composed of representatives from the health and social\ninstitutions of the municipality, the government, the police and NGOs, including Roma NGOs.\nHowever, the commission then only met twice, because of the lack of enthusiasm demonstrated by\nthe body’s coordinator (who represented the local government). Nowadays, the commission is only\nused for exchange of information. The positive aspects of the project are that there is greater\ncooperation between government institutions and NGOs, and between NGOs themselves, and\nRoma NGOs are more educated on drugs issues, although they still remain reluctant to work on\nharm reduction.\nHOPS recommended that harm reduction and other drug-related programmes be included in the\nnational budget for the Roma decade.\nMontenegro\nA proportion of 0.42% of the population in Montenegro is Roma. There are large numbers of\nrefugees from Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia in the country.

However, they are not empowered to educate themselves if they do not have the\nnationality of Montenegro. Since, according to the law, they do not have the right to health and\nsocial security if they are not on the job market, Roma people have little hope to get out of their\nsituation of poverty. It is therefore not surprising that about 40% of drug users originate from Roma\ncommunities. However, there is not a growing population of Roma IDUs in Montenegro, and Roma\npeople only represent 0.4% of the general population held in custody.\nJuventas has developed outreach activities with the general population, and specifically with IDUs,\nsex workers and MSM, the very groups that are most vulnerable to HIV infection. The presenter\ndeclared that there was no need to support any specific activities aimed specifically at Roma\ncommunities because they are integrated in mainstream society.\nRomania\nAccording to the last census conducted in 2002, there are half a million Roma people in Romania.\nHowever, this official figure is probably much lower than the real figure – many Roma register as\nRomanians for various reasons, one of which being to avoid stigma.\nOnly 16% of Roma were working legally in 2002. Of 535,000, only 13,348 were receiving financial\nsupport from the State or private organisations, and 135,100 relied on someone else’s support.\nMore than 200,000 Roma live in urban areas, but most of them work in rural areas or have jobs that\ndo not require any qualifications.\nThere is no official information regarding drug use among the Roma population. However, drug\nservice providers report a large number of Roma among their clients, especially at NSPs and\nservices to sex workers. Before the Revolution in 1989, the Roma controlled sex workers networks,\nwhich then expended. In the mid-1990s and 2000s, Roma gangs became interested in drug\ntrafficking and selling. Part of the pimp networks turned to drug trafficking, and sex workers\nthemselves started to use heroin. As Roma communities live in extended families, the dealers and\ntheir relatives started to use heroin as well.\nPart of the RHRN provides NSPs and substitution treatment. RHRN works with many Roma\ncommunities. Roma populations are particularly affected by the intravenous use of heroin and new\nlegal drugs, due to lack of education, poor hygiene and social marginalisation. Despite these issues,\nthere is no specific project targeted at Roma IDUs.\nDuring 2005 and 2006, OSI has initiated a series of regional consultations on Roma communities\naffected by drugs. Meetings were held in Budapest, Bucharest and Sofia, and involved Roma\nleaders. The participants were invited to visit the outreach services and NSPs, and realised that the\nmajority of clients were indeed Roma. Although many organisations combat stigma and\ndiscrimination against Roma, few of them are interested in harm reduction, mainly because they\nfear that this would add the social stigma attached to this group. Today, one Roma organisation\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

This is the only Roma organisation that accepted\nthat drug use was a problem among Roma.\nStarting in 2009, UNODC and EHRN organised a harm reduction summer school focusing on harm\nreduction among most-at-risk groups, including Roma. A scholarship programme was launched for\n5 Roma students to involve them in harm reduction activities and train them as future outreach\nleaders.\nOne of the main difficulties encountered by Roma activists is to include drug related issues in the\npolitical agenda and raise awareness among the general public, without adding more stigma\ntowards the Roma communities. For now, policy makers tend to focus on Roma inclusion and\naccess to education, health services and clean environments for Roma communities as a whole,\nand pay little attention to drug abuse and the harms associated with drug injection. The presenters\ntherefore recommended that:\n•\nSpecial provisions should be included in the HIV/AIDS strategy, the Romanian drugs\nstrategy and the Roma strategy regarding Roma IDUs and sex workers.\n•\nDrug abuse in Roma communities should be seen within a broader perspective: lack of\neducation, low hygiene and poverty facilitate drug abuse. Effective interventions should\nfocus on involving Roma leaders in mobilising affected communities.\nIDPC could support RHRN’s work by providing technical expertise on advocacy for including drug-\nrelated issues in the Roma strategy and other related policies.\nSerbia\nOfficially, there are 108,000 Roma people in Serbia, but the numbers are closer to half a million\naccording to human rights organisations. Outreach workers have reached around 200 Roma IDUs.\nSeveral surveys conducted by NGO service providers showed that 28.3% of the clients in drop-in\nwere young Roma IDUs.\nWith Round 8 of the Global Fund, some organisations tried to introduce initiatives aimed at Roma\npopulations, but the communities themselves showed a clear lack of interest in these services.\nThere is an important language, cultural and social barrier when one works with Roma populations.\nThe Roma populations are affected by specific problems related to sex work, human trafficking and\ndrug use that are different from the rest of the population. These communities therefore need to be\nreached with specific programmes adapted to their specific needs.\nOne of the most important problems among Roma communities is the lack of education, information\nand employment. NGO Veza tried to set up schools for Roma children in two camps, but it was very\nhard to have them involved. The NGO tried to attract them with the perspective of a free lunch at\nschool, but even this did not work very well.\nFour years ago, Serbia started the ‘Roma decade’ to promote the social inclusion of the Roma\npopulation, and improve their access to education, social and health security, HIV prevention,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1909901", "ocr": null}

This hinders their access to healthcare and other services. Medecins du\nMonde does not have a specific approach regarding Roma people – they are treated as every other\nclient.\nSlovenia\nAccording to available data, drug use among Roma populations is not an important problem in\nSlovenia – they tend to be disseminated in the country and are integrated to mainstream society.\nThe problems related to drug use among this community are therefore dealt with in the same way\nas for other drug users. Drug services are therefore accessible to everybody, including Roma drug\nusers.\nConcluding remarks for Session II\nThe intensity of the issue differs widely from country to country. In countries like Greece or Slovenia,\nthe problems related to Roma and drugs are minimal, whereas other countries such as FYR\nMacedonia, Montenegro, Romania or Serbia, the issue is much more prominent. One of the main\nissue is whether the Roma should be treated as a special minority or be undifferentiated within the\ngeneral population. Another question is how to encourage policy makers and human rights and\nRoma NGOs to include harm reduction and drugs issues in their political agenda, without increasing\nthe stigma associated with the Roma population.\nIDPC is planning to publish two briefing papers on the topics discussed at the meeting: one on harm\nreduction, and the other on Roma populations. The working group of the Network will be supporting\nIDPC in drafting these papers by providing input and information on the situation in their country.\nThese two sessions provided an important basis to start discussions on the issues. The members of\nthe Network are welcome to send IDPC any information on harm reduction and the Roma\npopulations in the coming months.\nReport from the meeting of the Working Group\nOn the evening of 28th September, the working group of the Network met to discuss the current\nstate of the Network and how to bring it forward in the coming months. The following information is a\nsummary of the discussions that took place during the working group’s meeting.\nRegional coordination and structure of the Network\nThe Network is a loose organisation. IDPC will keep supporting the Network in the near future with\nfunding from the European Commission (this grant runs until the 31st March 2011).

Recently,\nthe APF decided to stop working on drugs issues and will therefore no longer act as the lead\norganisation for the Network. Thanasis Apostolou is currently in the process of creating a new\norganisation in Greece that will replace the APF as the lead organisation of the Network. The\nNetwork will therefore operate as it did before.\nPresentation from KETHEA\nPhaedon Kaloterakis introduced its organisation, KETHEA, and presented a new institute aimed at\ntraining professionals on drugs issues. These trainings are currently provided in Greek, and the\ninitiative aims to provide the same trainings in English to non-Greeks. The institute will start\noperating next year and will provide scholarships to non-Greek participants. The Network’s\nparticipants are welcome to provide Phaedon (phaedon.kal@ketheathess.gr) with input and ideas\non the curriculum offered by the institute.\nSome participants declared that it would be interesting to include the academic sector in this\nNetwork to increase its status. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, there are many academics\nworking in the field of harm reduction. IDPC was seen as an important tool to change the image of\nthis initiative and raise awareness of harm reduction issues. This will be further discussed at the\nnext Network meeting in 2011.\nCollaboration with policy makers working on drug policy\nThe working group decided that the Network would not be officially launched before the next\nmeeting in 2011, where it would be discussed and carefully planned. The working group discussed\nthe vision, mission and policy principles that the Network would adopt. The group decided that the\npolicy principles would be re-written according to the comments gathered during the meeting. The\nobjective of the vision-mission-policy principles document is to introduce the Network to the outside\nworld, both to public authorities and the general public. The paper should reflect what the Network\nis, what it wants and how it will act. At the next meeting in 2011, IDPC will present a discussion\npaper including a new draft for the vision, mission and policy principles, along with a strategy on\nhow the document can be used with policy makers. This will provide the working group with a basis\nfor discussion.\nThe working group decided that in 2011, the working group meeting would also be coupled with a\nwider seminar gathering both NGO representatives and civil servants.\nClosing of the meeting\nThanasis Apostolou closed the meeting by thanking the participants for their active participation in\nthe discussions. Thanasis welcomed the new participants to the Network, especially those coming\nfrom new countries and those representing national governments.
